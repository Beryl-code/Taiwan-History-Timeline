                <h2>Qing Rule in Taiwan (1683â€“1895)</h2>
                <img src="images/Qing.svg">
				<p>
				After defeating the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, the Qing Empire made Taiwan part of Fujian Province. 
				At first, the Qing limited migration, but settlers from Fujian and Guangdong soon increased the population.
				</p>
				<h3>Control and Development</h3>
				<p>
				The Qing gradually expanded governance across the island, suppressed uprisings, and built administrative centers. 
				Taiwan became more integrated with Qing rule, though tensions with Indigenous groups remained.
				</p>
				<h3>From Province to Colony</h3>
				<p>
				Taiwan was made a province in 1885, but after the Qing lost the First Sino-Japanese War, 
				it was ceded to Japan in 1895, ending over 200 years of Qing rule.
