                    On July 15, 1987, after nearly 38 years, martial law in Taiwan was officially lifted by President Chiang Ching-kuo. 
                    It was one of the longest periods of martial law in the world and marked a major turning point in Taiwan’s history.

                    <h3>Why It Ended</h3>
                    <p>
                    By the mid-1980s, public pressure for political reform was growing. 
                    The Kaohsiung Incident and the formation of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) showed that people wanted more freedom. 
                    Taiwan’s economy was also growing quickly, and society was changing. 
                    Faced with these changes, President Chiang Ching-kuo decided that it was time to open up.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>What Changed</h3>
                    <p>
                    Lifting martial law ended the government’s power to arrest people without trial and allowed more freedom of speech, 
                    the press, and assembly. It also made it possible for new political parties to exist and for people to talk openly about Taiwan’s future.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>A New Chapter</h3>
                    <p>
                    The end of martial law did not bring full democracy overnight, but it was a big step forward. 
                    It allowed more political activity and led to future reforms, including Taiwan’s first direct presidential election in 1996. 
                    The lifting of martial law marked the beginning of a more open and democratic Taiwan.
