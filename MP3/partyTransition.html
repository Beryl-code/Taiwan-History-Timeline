				<h3>A Historic Election</h3>
				<p>
				In 2000, Taiwan held a presidential election that led to its first peaceful transfer of power between political parties. 
				Chen Shui-bian, the candidate from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won the election, 
				defeating the Kuomintang (KMT), which had ruled Taiwan since 1949.
				</p>

				<h3>Peaceful Transition</h3>
				<p>
				Although there were concerns about instability, the transition was calm and democratic. 
				Outgoing President Lee Teng-hui and the KMT accepted the results, allowing the new government to take office smoothly.
				</p>

				<h3>A Democratic Milestone</h3>
				<p>
                    The 2000 election marked the first time in Taiwan’s history that the country was not ruled by a dictator 
                    or led by the KMT. For the first time, a peaceful, democratic election brought a different party to power. 
                    This moment proved that Taiwan’s democracy had matured. It showed that political power could change hands through peaceful and fair elections, 
                    and it inspired greater trust in Taiwan’s democratic system both at home and around the world.
