				<p>
                    The Sunflower Student Movement was a protest led by students and activists in 2014. 
                    For the first time in Taiwan’s history, the Legislative Yuan was occupied by students. 
                    This action became a powerful symbol of civic participation and the defense of democratic values.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    The Sunflower Movement was a response to the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA), 
                    a trade deal between Taiwan and China that aimed to open up service sectors like finance, telecommunications, and healthcare. 
                    The agreement was negotiated by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) without full transparency, 
                    and critics feared it would increase Taiwan’s economic dependence on China and threaten local businesses and job opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Many Taiwanese, especially young people, were also concerned that the deal was being pushed through 
                    the legislature without proper review. The KMT tried to pass the agreement quickly, skipping article-by-article discussion, 
                    which sparked public outrage. This happened during a time of growing unease about China’s influence 
                    and Taiwan’s shrinking space in international politics.

                    <h3>The Occupation</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                    On March 18, 2014, protesters entered the Legislative Yuan in Taipei and remained inside for 24 days. 
                    Thousands of supporters gathered outside in peaceful solidarity, and at the movement’s peak, 
                    over 500,000 people joined a mass rally on Ketagalan Boulevard. 
                    The students demanded transparency and asked that the agreement be reviewed line by line.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                    The movement drew huge public support and gained international attention. 
                    It forced the government to temporarily suspend the trade agreement and sparked new conversations 
                    about democratic participation and Taiwan’s relationship with China. 
                    It also changed the face of Taiwan’s politics—many young leaders who participated in the movement 
                    went on to run for office and form new political parties, bringing fresh energy into the system. 
                    The public, especially young voters, became more politically engaged. 
                    In the 2016 election, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a major victory, gaining both the presidency and a majority in the legislature. 
                    The Sunflower Movement is remembered not only as a protest, but as the start of a new political generation in Taiwan.
