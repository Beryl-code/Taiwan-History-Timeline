                    The Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident (美麗島事件), was a pro-democracy demonstration that took place 
                    on International Human Rights Day, December 10, 1979. It marked a major turning point in Taiwan’s opposition movement 
                    against one-party authoritarian rule.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    During the late 1970s, public dissatisfaction with martial law and political repression was growing. 
                    A group of intellectuals, lawyers, and activists began publishing a magazine called <em>Formosa (美麗島)</em>, 
                    which advocated for human rights and democratic reform. These activists planned a peaceful rally in Kaohsiung 
                    to raise awareness of political freedoms.

                    <h3>The Protest and Crackdown</h3>
                    <p>
                    On the day of the rally, thousands gathered to listen to speeches and express frustration with the KMT regime. 
                    However, the event was quickly suppressed by riot police. Violent clashes broke out, and the government 
                    later used the incident to arrest the movement’s leaders.

                    <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well-known activists like Shih Ming-teh, Annette Lu, Chen Chu, and Chen Shui-bian were put on trial by the military. 
                        The arrests got attention around the world and made more people in Taiwan support the democracy movement. 
                        Even though political activity was still limited, the protest inspired others to keep working for change.
