				          <p>
                    After losing the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing Empire ceded Taiwan to Japan through the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. 
                    Although Taiwanese forces briefly declared the Republic of Formosa and resisted, Japan quickly suppressed the movement 
                    and established control. Taiwan became Japan’s first overseas colony.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Governance and Modernization</h3>
				    <p>
				    Japan ruled Taiwan with a centralized colonial administration. They developed modern infrastructure—railways, roads, hospitals, 
				    and schools—and industrialized sectors like sugar and rice production. These efforts aimed to benefit the empire but also 
				    brought significant changes to everyday life on the island.
				    </p>
				    <h3>Education and Cultural Policies</h3>
				    <p>
				    Japanese rule emphasized loyalty to the emperor and promoted assimilation through education and cultural policies. 
				    By the 1930s, the Kominka movement encouraged Taiwanese to adopt Japanese names, speak Japanese, and participate in Shinto rituals. 
				    While literacy rates rose, local identity and language were increasingly suppressed.

                      <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
                      <p>
                        Japanese rule left lasting infrastructure and administrative reforms.
                        It also influenced Taiwan’s legal and educational systems.
                        Many important buildings—like the current Presidential Office in Taipei—were constructed during this time,
                        blending Japanese and Western architectural styles.
                        The complex legacy includes both modernization and colonial trauma,
                        shaping how Taiwanese people view identity, sovereignty, and democracy today.
