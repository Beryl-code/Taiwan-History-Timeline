                <h2>Kingdom of Tungning (1662–1683)</h2>
                <img src="images/zheng.svg">
				<p>After the Dutch surrendered in 1662, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) established the Kingdom of Tungning in southern Taiwan. It became the first Chinese regime to govern the island.</p>
				<h3>A Ming Loyalist Stronghold</h3>
				<p>Koxinga intended to use Taiwan as a base to restore the fallen Ming dynasty on the mainland. His government introduced Chinese laws, promoted Confucian education, and encouraged immigration from Fujian, shaping early Han Chinese culture in Taiwan.</p>
				<h3>Rule and Legacy</h3>
				<p>The kingdom was ruled by Koxinga and later his son and grandson. Despite internal struggles and limited resources, Tungning developed Taiwan's economy and laid foundations for future governance.</p>
				<h3>The Qing Takeover</h3>
				<p>In 1683, the Qing dynasty launched a naval campaign against Tungning. After a decisive defeat, Koxinga’s grandson surrendered, and Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Empire, ending the kingdom’s 21-year rule.</p>
