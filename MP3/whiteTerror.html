                <p>
                    In May 19, 1949, after retreating from mainland China, the Republic of China (ROC) government imposed martial law in Taiwan. 
                    This began a nearly 40-year period of political repression known as the White Terror. 
                    The Kuomintang (KMT) sought to eliminate any threats to its rule, especially perceived communist influence.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Political Repression</h3>
                    <p>
                    Martial law granted the government sweeping powers. Dissent was not tolerated—those suspected of criticizing the regime, 
                    promoting Taiwanese independence, or having leftist views were arrested, often without evidence. 
                    Military courts handled civilian cases, and many were sentenced to prison or death.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Fear and Control</h3>
                    <p>
                    Under tight surveillance, daily life was shaped by fear. Informants were common, and people avoided political conversations, 
                    even with family. Books, newspapers, and classrooms promoted loyalty to the KMT and the image of Chiang Kai-shek 
                    as the nation’s leader. The memory of the 228 Massacre was erased from public discussion.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Prison and Punishment</h3>
                    <p>
                    Thousands were imprisoned on Green Island and other remote facilities. Many were held for decades, 
                    some subjected to forced confessions and torture. These prisons became symbols of the government’s harsh treatment 
                    of political dissenters and growing public resentment.
