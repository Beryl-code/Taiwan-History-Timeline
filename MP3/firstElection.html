                    On March 23, 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election—a major milestone in the island’s democratic journey. 
                    Before this, presidents were selected by the National Assembly rather than by the people.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    After martial law was lifted in 1987, Taiwan began a series of political reforms. 
                    Opposition parties were allowed, civil freedoms expanded, and in 1994, constitutional changes 
                    cleared the way for citizens to directly vote for their president and vice president.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>The Election</h3>
                    <p>
                    Four candidates ran for president:
                    <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                    <li>Lee Teng-hui 李登輝(Kuomintang/KMT), the former president</li>
                                    <li>Peng Ming-min 彭明敏(Democratic Progressive Party/DPP)</li>
                                    <li>Lin Yang-kang 林洋港(Independent)</li>
                                    <li>Chen Li-an 陳履安(Independent)</li>
                    </ul>
                    Lee Teng-hui won the election with 54% of the vote, becoming Taiwan’s first democratically elected president.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Significance</h3>
                    <p>
                    This election marked the end of one-party rule and showed the world that Taiwan had successfully transitioned 
                    from authoritarianism to democracy. It was a proud moment for the people, who could finally choose their leader through free and fair elections.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Missile Crisis</h3>
                    <p>
                    During the 1996 presidential election, China launched missile tests near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate voters and influence the outcome. 
                    The crisis drew international attention, and the United States responded by sending the USS Independence and USS Nimitz aircraft carriers 
                    to nearby waters. This event, known as the Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis (台灣海峽飛彈危機), only strengthened public determination to vote and defend democracy.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                    <p>
                    Despite threats and military pressure from China before the vote, voter turnout was high. 
                    Taiwanese citizens stood firm in their support for democracy. 
                    The success of the 1996 election set the foundation for Taiwan’s future as a democratic nation.
