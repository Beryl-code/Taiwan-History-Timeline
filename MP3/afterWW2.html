                <p>
                After Japan’s defeat in World War II, Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China (ROC) in October 1945, 
                with the approval of the Allied powers. This marked the end of 50 years of Japanese colonial rule. 
                The ROC, led by the Kuomintang (KMT) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, sent officials and military personnel 
                from the mainland to take control of the island.

                At first, many Taiwanese welcomed Chinese rule, expecting greater cultural freedom and national belonging. 
                However, the transition was rocky. The incoming KMT administration replaced experienced Japanese-trained officials 
                with unprepared mainland appointees, leading to inefficiency and disorganization. 
                Mounting corruption, rising inflation, and economic decline fueled widespread public frustration.

                Cultural and linguistic differences between Taiwanese residents and new mainland authorities deepened social divides. 
                By 1946, tensions were rising across the island as trust in the new government steadily eroded, 
                laying the groundwork for conflict that would erupt in the years to follow.
