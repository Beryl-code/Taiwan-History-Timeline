        <p>
          Between 1642 and 1662, the island of Taiwan—then known as <em>Formosa</em>—was under the control of the 
          Dutch East India Company (VOC).
        </p>

        <h3>Fort Zeelandia: A Colonial Hub</h3>
        <p>
          The Dutch established Fort Zeelandia in present-day Tainan, using it as their political and trade center.
          They promoted agriculture (especially sugar and rice), introduced Christianity, and turned Taiwan into
          a key part of regional maritime trade.
        </p>

        <h3>Resistance and Rebellion</h3>
        <p>
          Despite their efforts, the Dutch faced resistance from indigenous groups and pressure from external forces. 
          Discontent grew due to taxes and disruptions to local life.
        </p>

        <h3>The Rise of Koxinga</h3>
        <p>
          In 1661, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a Ming loyalist, launched a major assault on Dutch Formosa.
          After a nine-month siege, Fort Zeelandia was captured.
        </p>

        <h3>A Turning Point</h3>
        <p>
          In 1662, the Dutch surrendered, ending their 20-year rule. Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning,
          marking a new chapter in Taiwan’s history.
        </p>

          <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555; margin-top: 0px;">Flag of the Zheng Kingdom, symbol of Koxinga’s rule in Taiwan after the Dutch surrender in 1662.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          After the Dutch surrendered in 1662, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) established the Kingdom of Tungning in southern Taiwan.
          It became the first Chinese regime to govern the island.
        </p>

        <h3>A Ming Loyalist Stronghold</h3>
        <p>
          Koxinga intended to use Taiwan as a base to restore the fallen Ming dynasty on the mainland. His government introduced Chinese laws, 
          promoted Confucian education, and encouraged immigration from Fujian, shaping early Han Chinese culture in Taiwan.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule and Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          The kingdom was ruled by Koxinga and later his son and grandson. Despite internal struggles and limited resources, 
          Tungning developed Taiwan's economy and laid foundations for future governance.
        </p>

        <h3>The Qing Takeover</h3>
        <p>
          In 1683, the Qing dynasty launched a naval campaign against Tungning. After a decisive defeat, Koxinga’s grandson surrendered, 
          and Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Empire, ending the kingdom’s 21-year rule.
        </p>

        <h2>Qing Rule in Taiwan 清治時期(1683–1895)</h2>
        <div class="portrait-section" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 800px; text-align: center;">
          <img src="images/Qing.svg" alt="Yellow flag with a blue dragon and red sun, symbolizing the Qing dynasty's imperial rule." style=" margin: auto; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
          <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555; margin-top: 0px;">Flag of the Qing dynasty, which ruled Taiwan after defeating the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683.

          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          After defeating the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, the Qing Empire made Taiwan part of Fujian Province. 
          At first, the Qing limited migration, but settlers from Fujian and Guangdong soon increased the population.
        </p>

        <h3>Control and Development</h3>
        <p>
          The Qing gradually expanded governance across the island, suppressed uprisings, and built administrative centers. 
          Taiwan became more integrated with Qing rule, though tensions with Indigenous groups remained.
        </p>

        <h3>From Province to Colony</h3>
        <p>
          Taiwan was made a province in 1885, but after the Qing lost the First Sino-Japanese War, 
          it was ceded to Japan in 1895, ending over 200 years of Qing rule.
