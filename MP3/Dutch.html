                <img src="images/dutch.jpg">
				<p>
					Between 1642 and 1662, the island of Taiwan—then known as <em>Formosa</em>—was under the control of the 
					Dutch East India Company (VOC).
				</p>

				<h3>Fort Zeelandia: A Colonial Hub</h3>
				<p>
					The Dutch established Fort Zeelandia in present-day Tainan, using it as their political and trade center.
					They promoted agriculture (especially sugar and rice), introduced Christianity, and turned Taiwan into
					a key part of regional maritime trade.
				</p>

				<h3>Resistance and Rebellion</h3>
				<p>
					Despite their efforts, the Dutch faced resistance from indigenous groups and pressure from external forces. 
					Discontent grew due to taxes and disruptions to local life.
				</p>

				<h3>The Rise of Koxinga</h3>
				<p>
					In 1661, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a Ming loyalist, launched a major assault on Dutch Formosa.
					After a nine-month siege, Fort Zeelandia was captured.
				</p>

				<h3>A Turning Point</h3>
				<p>
					In 1662, the Dutch surrendered, ending their 20-year rule. Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning,
					marking a new chapter in Taiwan’s history.
