                <img src="images/gay.jpg">
				<p>
                    On May 24, 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. 
                    This was a landmark moment for human rights and equality, showing the strength of Taiwan’s democracy and civil society.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    In 2017, Taiwan’s Constitutional Court ruled that laws banning same-sex marriage were unconstitutional and gave the government two years to fix the law. 
                    This sparked both support and debate across society. Many LGBTQ+ activists and allies organized public campaigns, while opponents pushed for referendums.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Law</h3>
                    <p>
                    On May 17, 2019, the Legislative Yuan passed a special law allowing same-sex couples to legally marry. 
                    One week later, on May 24, the law went into effect, and hundreds of couples registered their marriages on the first day.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Significance</h3>
                    <p>
                    The law made Taiwan the first nation in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage, setting a powerful example for the region. 
                    It showed that democratic values like equality, dignity, and human rights are deeply rooted in Taiwanese society. 
                    For many, this victory also reflected years of grassroots organizing, legal advocacy, and growing public acceptance.
