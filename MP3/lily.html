                    The Wild Lily Student Movement was a peaceful protest led by college students in March 1990. 
                    It became one of the most important events in Taiwan’s path toward full democracy.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    In 1990, Taiwan was still not fully democratic. The president was elected by the National Assembly, 
                    a body made up of mostly older representatives who had not been directly elected by the people. 
                    Many of them had held power since the ROC government moved to Taiwan in 1949.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>The Protest</h3>
                    <p>
                    On March 16, over 300 students gathered in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. 
                    They wore white lilies to symbolize peace and purity. Their main demands were for direct presidential elections 
                    and the full reform of Taiwan’s political system. The protest grew quickly and gained strong support from the public.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Peaceful Response and Results</h3>
                    <p>
                    Unlike in past decades, the government did not use force. Instead, newly inaugurated President Lee Teng-hui 
                    met with student representatives and promised political reforms. Just a few years later, Taiwan held its first 
                    direct presidential election in 1996. The movement is now seen as a key moment when the younger generation 
                    pushed Taiwan closer to true democracy.
