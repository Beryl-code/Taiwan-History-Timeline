                    Following rising tensions between native Taiwanese and the newly arrived ROC authorities, 
                    a violent incident on February 27, 1947, ignited widespread unrest. 
                    The tragic events that followed would mark a turning point in Taiwan’s modern history.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>The Spark</h3>
                    <p>
                    On the night of February 27, agents from the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau assaulted a local woman selling cigarettes illegally in Taipei. 
                    When onlookers protested, one was shot and killed. The next day, mass protests erupted across the island, 
                    reflecting deep dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang (KMT) government’s corruption, economic mismanagement, and oppressive behavior.
                    </p>
				<h3>Suppression and Violence</h3>
				<p>
				In response to the uprising, Chiang Kai-shek ordered military reinforcements from mainland China. 
				As troops arrived in March, they launched a brutal crackdown. Intellectuals, students, and community leaders were targeted. 
				Thousands were arrested or executed without trial. Estimates of the death toll range from 10,000 to 30,000.

                <h3>Long-Term Impact</h3>
                
				<p>
				The massacre ushered in a period of political repression known as the White Terror, during which martial law suppressed dissent for decades. 
				For many years, public discussion of the event was forbidden. 
				It wasn’t until the 1990s that the government formally acknowledged responsibility and began promoting transitional justice.
				</p>

				<h3>Memory and Remembrance</h3>
				<p>
				Today, the 228 Massacre is remembered as a key moment in Taiwan’s democratic journey. 
				February 28 is observed as Peace Memorial Day, a national holiday. 
				The 228 Peace Memorial Park in Taipei, home to the 228 Memorial Monument and a museum, honors the victims and serves as a place of reflection and education.
