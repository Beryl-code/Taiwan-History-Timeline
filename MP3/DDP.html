                    After years of political control under martial law, many people in Taiwan wanted change. 
                    Even though forming new political parties was still illegal, a group of brave activists came together 
                    on September 28, 1986, to create the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>A Risky Decision</h3>
                    <p>
                    At the time, Taiwan was still under martial law, and only the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) was allowed to exist as a political party. 
                    Creating a new party was against the law. But these activists believed that Taiwan needed more voices, 
                    and they were willing to take the risk to stand up for democracy, freedom, and human rights.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>Goals and Ideas</h3>
                    <p>
                    The DPP called for the end of martial law, fair elections, freedom of speech, and a more open government. 
                    It also pushed for more rights for local Taiwanese people, and greater discussion about Taiwan’s identity and future.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>First Steps Toward Democracy</h3>
                    <p>
                    Even though it was not officially legal, the government chose not to shut the DPP down. 
                    This showed that change was coming. Just one year later, in 1987, martial law was lifted. 
                    The DPP’s creation was one of the first big steps that led Taiwan toward becoming the free and democratic society it is today.
