                <p>
                    Over the past few years, Taiwan has become increasingly visible and respected on the international stage. 
                    As a vibrant democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a nation committed to human rights, 
                    Taiwan continues to earn global attention and admiration. 
                    Despite its complicated international status and pressure from China, Taiwan shows the world what a resilient, free society can achieve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Although Taiwan is located close to China, where COVID-19 first spread, and was excluded from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
                    it managed to respond quickly and effectively. Through a combination of science, public trust, and transparent communication, 
                    Taiwan controlled the outbreak better than most countries. Schools, businesses, and daily life remained open for much of the pandemic, 
                    and Taiwan became an example of how a democratic society could face a crisis with unity, intelligence, and care for its people.

                    <p>
                    Taiwan's growing importance has been recognized by democratic nations around the world. 
                    In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen, 
                    a bold move that showed clear support for Taiwan’s democracy. 
                    Although the visit angered Beijing, it drew global attention and reminded the world that Taiwan is not alone. 
                    More parliaments, leaders, and international organizations are beginning to speak up for Taiwan’s right to participate 
                    in the global community as a responsible and democratic partner.

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Silicon Shield</h3>
                    <p>
                    Taiwan is home to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s most advanced chipmaker. 
                    Its semiconductors power nearly every modern device—from smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles and satellites. 
                    This unique role has given Taiwan what many call a "silicon shield"—a form of soft power and global influence. 
                    Taiwan’s chip industry not only drives the world’s economy, but also makes its security a global concern. 
                    Many nations now recognize that protecting Taiwan’s stability means protecting the technological foundation of modern life.

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Challenges from China</h3>
                    <p>
                    Despite its achievements, Taiwan continues to face daily pressure from the People’s Republic of China. 
                    China blocks Taiwan from joining the UN and international bodies like the WHO, spreads disinformation, 
                    and sends military aircraft near Taiwan's airspace to intimidate. 
                    Yet Taiwan refuses to back down. It continues to build a strong, inclusive democracy that respects freedom, human rights, and open debate. 
                    Even under constant threat, the people of Taiwan remain committed to their way of life—and have earned admiration and support 
                    from citizens and governments around the world who value peace, democracy, and dignity.
